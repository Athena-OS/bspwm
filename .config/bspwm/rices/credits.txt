I'm excited to present my customized integration of HackTheBox, which I've poured a lot of effort into. This project was inspired by the brilliant work of z0mbi3 and adi1090x, and I've taken it a step further by enhancing themes, adding numerous scripts, and even implementing support for dual monitors. I hope you all find this integration valuable, and don't forget to show your support by giving the below repositories a star. Check out the original author's work; they've truly laid the foundation for this project.
